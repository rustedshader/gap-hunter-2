1. Authorize access to the information system based on a valid access authorization or intended system usage.

1. Review accounts for compliance with account management requirements [entity defined frequency].

1. Establish a process for reissuing shared/group account credentials (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group.

1. Employ automated mechanisms to support the management of information system accounts.

1. Ensure that the information system automatically disables temporary and emergency accounts after usage.

1. Ensure that the information system automatically disables inactive accounts after [entity defined frequency]

1. Ensure that the information system automatically audits account creation, modification, enabling, disabling, and removal actions, and notifies appropriate IT personnel.

1. ACCESS ENFORCEMENT

1. INFORMATION FLOW ENFORCEMENT

IT Department shall:

1. Ensure that the information system enforces approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between interconnected systems based on applicable policy.

1. SEPARATION OF DUTIES

IT Department shall:

1. Separate duties of individuals as necessary, to prevent malevolent activity without collusion.

1. Document the separation of duties of individuals.

1. Define information system access authorizations to support separation of duties.

1. LEAST PRIVILEGE

IT Department shall:

1. Employ the principle of least privilege, allowing only authorized accesses for users (or processes acting on behalf of users) which are necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with organizational missions and business functions.

1. Authorize explicitly access to hardware and software controlling access to systems and filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists.

1. Require that users of information system accounts, or roles, with access to [entity defined security functions or security-relevant information], use non-privileged accounts or roles, when accessing non-security functions.

1. Restrict privileged accounts on the information system to [entity defined personnel or roles].

1. Ensure that the information system audits the execution of privileged functions.

1. Ensure that the information system prevents non-privileged users from executing privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented security safeguards/countermeasures.

1. UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS

IT Department shall ensure that the information system:

1. Enforces a limit of consecutive invalid logon attempts by a user during a [entity defined frequency].

1. Locks the account/node automatically for [entity defined frequency] or until released by an administrator when the maximum number of unsuccessful attempts is exceeded.

1. SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION

IT Department shall ensure that the information system:

1. Displays to users an approved system use notification message or banner before granting access to the system that provides privacy and security notices consistent with applicable state and federal laws, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance and states informing that:

1. Users are accessing a [entity] information system.

1. Information system usage may be monitored, recorded, and subject to audit.

1. Unauthorized use of the information system is prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties.

1. Use of the information system indicates consent to monitoring and recording.

1. There are not rights to privacy.

1. Retains the notification message or banner on the screen until users acknowledge the usage conditions and take explicit actions to log on to or further access the information system.

1. For publicly accessible systems, the IT Department shall ensure that the information system:

1. Displays system use information [entity defined conditions], before granting further access.

1. Displays references, if any, to monitoring, recording, or auditing that are consistent with privacy accommodations for such systems that generally prohibit those activities.

1. Includes a description of the authorized uses of the system.

1. SESSION LOCK

IT Department shall ensure that the information system:

1. Prevent further access to the system by initiating a session lock after [entity defined frequency] of inactivity or upon receiving a request from a user.

1. Retain the session lock until the user reestablishes access using established identification and authentication procedures.

1. Conceal, via the session lock, information previously visible on the display with a publicly viewable image.

1. SESSION TERMINATION

IT Department shall:

1. Ensure that the information system automatically terminates a user session after [entity defined frequency].

1. PERMITTED ACTIONS WITHOUT IDENTIFICATION OR AUTHENTICATION

IT Department shall:

1. Identify user actions that can be performed on the information system without identification or authentication consistent with organizational missions and business functions.

1. Document and provide supporting rationale in the security plan for the information system, user actions not requiring identification or authentication.

1. REMOTE ACCESS

IT Department shall:

1. Establish and document usage restrictions, configuration/connection requirements, and implementation guidance for each type of remote access allowed.

1. Authorize remote access to the information system prior to allowing such connections.

1. Ensure that the information system monitors and controls remote access methods.

1. Ensure that the information system implements cryptographic mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of remote access sessions.

1. Ensure that the information system routes all remote accesses through [entity defined number] managed network access control points to reduce the risk for external attacks.

1. Authorize the execution of privileged commands and access to security-relevant information via remote access only for [entity defined needs].

1. Document the rationale for such access in the security plan for the information system.

1. WIRELESS ACCESS

IT Department shall:
